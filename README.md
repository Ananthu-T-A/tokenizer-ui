## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to Tokenizer Visualizer! This application helps you understand how different tokenizers split text and images into tokens. By using distinct colors for each token, you can easily see how various models handle your input.

## 🚀 Features

### 📚 Text Tokenization

- **Multiple Tokenizer Support:** Work with popular tokenizers like GPT-2, Mistral, Gemma, Qwen, Phi-2, BERT, and OPT.
- **Real-Time Tokenization:** Get instant feedback as you type, ensuring you see results without delay.
- **Color-Coded Visualization:** Each token appears in a unique color, making it easy to differentiate between them.
- **Statistics Display:** View token counts and character counts alongside your text.
- **Hover Tooltips:** Place your mouse over any token to see its token ID quickly.
- **Special Character Visuals:** See spaces represented as ·, newlines as ↵, and tabs as →, aiding in clarity.

### 🖼️ Multimodal Tokenization (NEW!)

- **Qwen2-VL Support:** Tokenize both text and images with ease using advanced multimodal capabilities.
- **Interleaved Content:** Add as many text and image blocks as you wish for comprehensive analysis.
- **Drag-and-Drop Image Upload:** Quickly and effortlessly upload images to visualize.
- **Visual Representations for Images:** Group image tokens labeled as "IMAGE (N tokens)" for better understanding.
- **Understand Vision-Language Models:** See how different models tokenize combined text and images.
